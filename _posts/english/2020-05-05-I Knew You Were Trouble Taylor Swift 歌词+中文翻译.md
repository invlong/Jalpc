Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
从前从前那些错误铸成前
I was in your sights, you got me alone
我走进了你的视线在我寂寞时你钻进我心底
You found me, you found me, you found me
你发现了我 你发现了我 你发现了我
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
我猜你蛮不在乎 我猜我就喜欢你这调调
And when I fell hard you took a step back
当我跌得凄惨 你却见风转舵
Without me, without me, without me
离开我 离开我 离开我
And he's long gone when he's next to me
他的心早已不在 当他人在我身边
And I realize the blame is on me
而我意识到 只能怪我自己
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
'Til you put me down, oh
直至你将我推下
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
不曾道歉 他永远不会看见那些眼泪
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
佯装得他不知情 他就是那原因
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
你往下沉没 你往下沉没 你往下沉没
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
我听说你已向前看 走出街上的流言蜚语
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
一直以来我举足不过 是你的新战绩
And now I see, now I see, now I see
如今我看清 如今我看清 如今我看清
He was long gone when he met me
他的心早已不在 当他人在我身边
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
而我意识到 只能怪我自己
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
'Til you put me down, oh
直至你将我推下
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
那最可悲的恐惧 匍匐爬入心中
That you never loved me or her,
你不曾爱过我 或着她
or anyone, or anything, yeah
或任何人 任何事
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
'Til you put me down, oh
直至你将我推下
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
So shame on me now
如今我如此不堪
Flew me to places I'd never been
使我流浪到 我不曾身处的局面
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
如今我身躺在冰冷坚硬的地板
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
噢 噢 大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
Trouble, trouble, trouble
大麻烦 大麻烦 大麻烦
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
因早当你走进来 我就料到你是个大麻烦
